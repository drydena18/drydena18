# Welcome to My GitHub Profile!

Hi there! I'm Dryden, and this profile showcases my ongoing research, personal projects, and learning journey in the fields of neuroscience, data science, and computational modeling. I focus on integrating cutting-edge statistical techniques and programming tools to analyze complex datasets, primarily in the realm of human cognition and development.

## üî¨ Research & Projects

I work on interdisciplinary projects that bridge neuroscience, machine learning, and data science. Some of my primary areas of focus include:

- **EEG Data Analysis**: Exploring brain connectivity and cognitive development through electrophysiological data.
- **Statistical Modeling**: Applying advanced statistical methods, such as Generalized Additive Models (GAMs), to analyze complex neural data.
- **Neuroscience**: Investigating neural development and cognitive disorders.

My key projects include:
- Research into developmental differences in brain connectivity profiles in children and adolescents.
- Statistical analysis and machine learning applications for understanding neural patterns and cognitive processes.

## üß† Skills & Learning Journey

Throughout my research and personal projects, I've developed expertise in the following areas:

- **Statistical Analysis**: Proficient in using advanced models like GAMs to analyze complex datasets.
- **Data Processing**: Experience with preprocessing and cleaning EEG data, handling noisy and unstructured data.
- **Machine Learning**: Applying machine learning techniques to extract insights and make predictions from neural data.
- **Programming**: Skilled in Python, R, MATLAB, and JavaScript for data analysis, visualization, and interactive web applications.
- **Visualization**: Creating meaningful data visualizations using tools like `matplotlib`, `seaborn`, `ggplot2`, and **EEGLAB**.

## üõ† Technologies & Tools

- **R** (mgcv, ggplot2)
- **Python** (pandas, numpy, scipy, MNE, scikit-learn)
- **MATLAB**
- **EEGLAB** (EEG data analysis)
- **JavaScript** (for web applications)
- **Google Sheets** (for data organization)
- **Machine Learning** & **Statistical Modeling**

## ‚öôÔ∏è Setup & Dependencies

To get started with any of my projects, simply:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Install dependencies for Python or R:

   For Python, you can install dependencies with:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
   For R, all required packages are outlined in the scripts.

## üöÄ Future Directions

I am continually expanding my knowledge in the following areas:
- Advancing machine learning techniques for neural data analysis.
- Exploring new ways to interpret electrophysiological data.
- Data analysis, data visualization, and coding in general.
